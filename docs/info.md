## How it works

he tt_um_mac module is a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit designed for high-performance digital signal processing and embedded system applications. This module integrates a Dadda multiplier and a Kogge-Stone adder to achieve efficient and fast computations. The MAC unit performs a sequence of multiplication and accumulation operations, which are essential in various digital signal processing tasks, such as filtering and convolution. Functional Description Input and Output Ports • Inputs: o ui_in (8-bit): Dedicated input for the first operand. o uio_in (8-bit): Input/Output interface for the second operand. o clk (1-bit): Clock signal to synchronize all operations. o rst_n (1-bit): Active-low reset signal to initialize the internal state of the MAC unit. • Outputs: o uo_out (8-bit): Output that holds the final accumulated result. o uio_oe (8-bit): Output enable signal, set to 0 indicating the uio is used as input. o uio_out (8-bit): Unused output p
